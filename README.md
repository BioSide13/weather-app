# Weather App

This simple weather app uses the Open Weather api to get the weather data of your city!

## Useage
To use the app download all the files and open the index.html file in your preffered web browswer. Input your city, press search and you get the weather! You can even tap the drop down menu on the bottom right to change the background!

## Custom Backgrounds
If you want to add custom backgrounds just upload them to the backgrounds folder and add them in the html code. Just add the following code in the image-dropdown div:
`<img src="./backgrounds/image_name.jpg" alt="Image 5" onclick="setBackground('./backgrounds/image_name.jpg')"> `
This line will add your background to the background changed menu!
